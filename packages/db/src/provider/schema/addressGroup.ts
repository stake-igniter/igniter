 * - `id`: A unique identifier for each address group. It is a primary key and is auto-generated.
 * - `name`: The name of the address group. This field is required.
 * - `linkedAddresses`: An array of linked address values. Defaults to an empty array.
 * - `private`: A boolean flag indicating whether the address group is private. This field is required and defaults to `false`.
 * - `relayMinerId`: References the primary key of the `relay_miners` table, representing the associated relay miner. This field is required and enforces the `RESTRICT` delete rule.
 * - `createdAt`: A timestamp indicating when the address group was created. Defaults to the current timestamp.
 * - `createdBy`: References the `identity` field in the `users` table, indicating the user who created the address group. This field is required.
 * - `updatedAt`: A timestamp indicating the last time the address group was updated. Automatically updated on modification.
 * - `updatedBy`: References the `identity` field in the `users` table, representing the user who last updated the address group. This field is required.
