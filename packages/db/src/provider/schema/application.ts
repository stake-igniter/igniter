 * - `chainId`: The associated blockchain chain ID, required and defined by an enumeration.
 * - `minimumStake`: The minimum stake amount required for the application, required and stored as an integer.
 * - `isBootstrapped`: A boolean value indicating if the application is bootstrapped, required.
 * - `rpcUrl`: The RPC URL for application interaction, required.
 * - `indexerApiUrl`: The API URL for indexing services, optional.
 * - `updatedAtHeight`: Optional field that tracks the blockchain height at the last update, stored as a string.
 * - `createdAt`: Timestamp indicating when the setting was created. Automatically set to the current time by default.
 * - `createdBy`: The identity of the user who created the application setting. It is required and references the `identity` field in the `users` table.
